                The Bangalore Palace was the private residence of the royal Wodeyar family. Built to resemble Windsor Castle, this quirky palace is filled with an interesting and eclectic collection of art and paraphernalia from a bygone era. The palace grounds are a popular venue for rock concerts and other music events.

        <h3>About Lalbagh:</h3> <br>
        <p>Hyder Ali commissioned the building of this garden in 1760, but his son, Tipu Sultan, completed it. A Bagh is Hindustani for garden while the reference of the prefix Lal is debated and could refer to the colour red due to its original floral composition but Lal also means "beloved". Hyder Ali decided to create this garden on the lines of the Mughal Gardens that were gaining popularity during his time.<br>
             Hyder Ali laid out these famous botanical gardens and his son Tipu Sultan added horticultural wealth to them by importing trees and plants from several countries. Hyder and Tipu's Lalbagh gardens were managed by Mohammed Ali and his son Abdul Khader, and were based on design of the Mughal Gardens that once stood at Sira, at a distance of 120 km from Bangalore.<br>
              At that time, Sira was the headquarters of the strategically important southernmost Mughal "suba" (province) of the Deccan before the British Raj</p>

    <h2>Explore the Bull Temple in Basavanagudi, dedicated to Nandi, the sacred bull.</h2>

            <H3>History on the Bull Temple</H3>
            <p>
                Nandi, meaning ‘joy’ in Sanskrit, is the sacred bull according to Hindu beliefs. Though the Nandi statue appears to be black in color, it was not really the case when it was built. The idol was originally grey in color. But as devotees continuously applied charcoal and oil to the statue, it blackened over the years.
    
    According to a myth, the iron plate on the bull’s head has been placed there by Lord Shiva to stop the idol from growing. <br>
    An inscription at the temple states that the Vrishabhavathi River flowing through Western part of Bengaluru has its origins from a spring located beneath the Nandi statue.
