        <H3>About Cubbon Park </H3>
        
        <br>
        
        <P>
            The Cubbon Park, officially known as Sri. Chamarajendra Park is a historic park, located in the heart of the city in the Central Administrative Area. The park provides sylvan surroundings to the State Legislature building- the Vidhana Soudha, the High Court Buildings – the Attara Kacheri and a number of other organizations located along the periphery and within the park which constitute the Central Administrative Area.

The Cubbon Park has a history of over 100 years. It was established in the year 1870 by Sri John Meade, the then acting Commissioner of Mysore. The vast landscape of the park was conceived by Major General Richard Sankey, the then Chief Engineer of the State. As a mark of honor to Sri John Meade, the park was initially named as “Meade’s Park” and subsequently it was called the Cubbon Park. Since the inception of the park, it was developed and improved by adding new structures and features. In the year 1927, the park was officially renamed as “Sri. Chamarajendra Park” to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Sri. Krishnaraja Wodeyar’s rule in Mysore State.

        <img class="img2" src="images/vish.jfif" alt="error">
        <br>
<p>
    The reality of the museum began with the germ of an idea born in the mind of a visionary journalist and nationalist, Mr. B N Guptha. Having travelled widely and inspired by museums in the West like the Smithsonian, he came up with the idea of establishing a similar museum in Bengaluru in 1958.<br><br>

    VITM was opened to the public on July 14, 1962 by the then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the presence of scientific and political luminaries. The museum proudly housed various industrial products and engines.<br><br>
    
    Under the steady stewardship of CSIR, there was a significant transformation in the museum’s character; from being an industrial museum, it also became a science museum. In fact, VITM counts its birthday as July 27, 1965 – the day the first gallery was inaugurated.<br><br>
    
    With the setting up of the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) in 1978, VITM came under its aegis. Apart from significantly ramping up the activities in the museum in Bengaluru, NCSM made VITM its nodal centre for South India and encouraged the setting up of science centres with state-of-the-art exhibits and activities. Thus, VITM has an influential role of moulding public interest in science in the southern part of the country.<br><br>

    <h3>About Bangalore Art District in Banglore</h3> <br>
    <p>It was yet another opening at Gallery Sumukha, founded in Bangalore in 1996.  About 200 people crowded into the space, discussing the art and sharing opinions.  What was distinctive about this group? The absence of anyone from the IT industry for one.  “We have never had anyone from the IT industry visit our gallery or buy our work,” said owner, Premilla Baid.  “We’ve always wondered why.  Do they support other things like theatre or do they simply not connect to the art and culture scene in Bangalore?”

        Bangalore’s art scene is still nascent compared to Delhi or Mumbai. In the sixties and seventies, influential artists such as K.K. Hebbar moved out of the city to gain fame.  In the 1980s, artists such as S.G. Vasudev, Balan Nambiar, Yusuk Arakkal and Gurudas Shenoy lay down roots in Bangalore and infused imaginative regionalism into the framework of Indian Modernist art.  They used spirituality, crafts and folk idioms in their work, showing largely outside Bangalore.  Government museums such as the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath (CKP) and Venkatappa Art Gallery were viewed as old-fashioned moribund institutions.</p>
